# Garment Industry Dataset  
## Productivity Prediction of Garment Industry Dataset

The Garment Industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization of this modern era. It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. 
Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies. 
So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry to track, analyze and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories.

# Problem Statement

This dataset includes important attributes of the garment manufacturing process and the productivity of the employees which had been collected manually and also been validated by the industry experts. 
Sample data collected through the period from Jan 2015 to Mar 2015
It can be used for regression purpose by predicting the productivity range (0-1) or for classification purpose by transforming the productivity range (0-1) into 
classes.
To build a model which is efficient in either
predicting the productivity of the workers 
                                    (or)
predicting if the workers can achieve the set target
